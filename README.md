nxcommon
========

This library contains a bunch of utility classes, functions and other goodies that might be of interest to multiple different C/C++ projects.

I started libnxcommon out of the feeling that I often had to rewrite the same code over and over in different projects of mine, so to save me some time, I packaged some of the basic utilities into what is my personal (personal as in: used throughout and tailored to my own projects) extended C/C++ standard library.

Most of the code in here was originally part of my gtatools project, mainly from the utilities in libgtaformats.
